# A more Simpler Converter
It can convert MT Framework .gmd script files (from Ace Attorney - Dual Destinies and Ace Attorney - Spirit of Justice, 3DS versions) to RE Engine .user2 script files (Apollo Justice Trilogy). 

The only use case is probably FanTranslations,Custom Cases, Ports etc.

Just fill the config file and run the bat file.
